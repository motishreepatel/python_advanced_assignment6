    "#Q1 - Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "#Answer:\n",
    "Exception processing, also known as error handling or exception handling, is a crucial aspect of writing robust and reliable code. \n",
    "Here are three common applications for exception processing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error Reporting and Handling: Exception processing allows you to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of your code. \n",
    "It helps in identifying and reporting errors to the user in a controlled and informative manner, rather than allowing the program to crash \n",
    "or produce unexpected results. By catching exceptions, you can display meaningful error messages, log the error details, and gracefully \n",
    "handle exceptional situations to ensure the program continues running smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Validation and Error Recovery: Exception processing is useful for validating user input and detecting invalid or unexpected values. \n",
    "When processing user input, you can anticipate potential errors, such as incorrect data types, out-of-range values, or malformed input. \n",
    "By raising exceptions, you can notify the user of the issue and prompt them to provide valid input. Additionally, exception handling can \n",
    "help in recovering from errors by providing alternative paths or fallback options to ensure the program can continue execution even if \n",
    "certain inputs or operations fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource Management and Cleanup: Exception processing is instrumental in managing resources, such as file handling, network connections, \n",
    "and database connections. When working with external resources, exceptions can occur due to various factors, such as file not found, \n",
    "network errors, or database connectivity issues. Exception handling allows you to release or clean up resources properly, even in \n",
    "the presence of exceptions. For example, you can use the try-finally block to ensure that resources are closed or released regardless of \n",
    "whether an exception occurs."
